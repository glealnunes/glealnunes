# 👨🏽‍💻 About Me

Hello! I'm Gesser Filho, a passionate **Front-End Developer** from Bahia,Brazil focused on creating engaging, responsive and user-friendly web interfaces.

I love creating beautiful UI experiences that are not only visually appealing but also highly functional and accessible. I've specialized in the React ecosystem, building dynamic and interactive web applications with modern development patterns.

My most recent experience was as a **Junior Front-End Developer at Nasajon**, where I transformed design specifications into responsive interfaces that met project requirements. I'm committed to writing clean and maintainable code, while continuously improving my skills in modern web technologies.

I believe great front-end development combines technical expertise with creative problem solving and empathy for the user — and that's the approach I bring to every project I work on.

Naturally curious. Always coding. Always innovating!
