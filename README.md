## 🧠 About Me

I love creating beautiful UI experiences that are not only visually appealing but also highly functional and accessible. With 5 years of experience in software development, I've specialized in the React ecosystem, building dynamic and interactive web applications with modern development patterns.

My most recent experience was as a Junior Front-End Developer at Nasajon, where I transformed design specifications into responsive interfaces that met project requirements. I'm committed to writing clean and maintainable code, while continuously improving my skills in modern web technologies.

I believe great front-end development combines technical expertise with creative problem solving and empathy for the user — and that's the approach I bring to every project I work on.

*Naturally curious. Always coding. Always innovating!*
